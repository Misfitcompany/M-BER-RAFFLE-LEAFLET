Minting the trait does not guarantee a raffle win; once the raffle has started, if they have filled out the entry form holders of NFTs with the correct "SWAPwMISFIT" trait are the wallet addresses collected for the raffle drawing.

Should this display be publicly archived for participant and creator trust? Considering it for this raffle but I would like feedback if anyone is willing to share.

### Artist NFT collection claim exmeption
Anna IRL #160 & Qmarks CXLI are exempt for redemption, these were to be moved to another wallet before raffle launch but the day I went to launch this, the Qubicbay NFT transfers seemed to be having issues. These 2 NFTs will be removed once transfers are available again.
